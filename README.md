Hadoop Playground
======

Playground for Basic Hadoop MapReduce Programs(streamed with python). These programs are also written in Pig and Hive to get an idea about the contrasts in respective methods. 


Temperature
------

Finds the maximum temperature from several years using mapReduce. A Basic dataset is included within `sample.txt` and `pig-sample.txt`. Data used is just a small subset of data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC, http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). The data is stored using a line-oriented ASCII format, in which each line is a record in file `sample.txt` whereas a tab-delimited (cleaner)version is saved in `pig-sample.txt`.
